    "3:Problems solving Decomposing a complex problem into smaller chunks or discrete\n",
    "components is a good practice. OOP is specialized in this behavior, as it breaks \n",
    "down your software code into bite-sized – one object at a time. In doing this the\n",
    "broken components can be reused in solutions to different other problems (both less\n",
